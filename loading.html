QUESTION:
Suppose the following script is running on a web page. 
Can you please tell us what the execution result would be? Can you please explain why?

The execution may not load correctly since the helloWorld() function is being called right.

While the loadScript parameter '/js/main.js' appends to the head, the helloWorld() function may not
be available since the '/js/main.js' is loaded asynchronosly, which means that the rest of the code in the 
script continues without waiting for the new script '/js/main.js' to finish loading. In most cases this would 
cause the page not to load but it might sometimes appear to work ok since the '/js/main.js' code might in fact load
before the rest of the script finishes loading.

To ensure this doesn't happen, it would be better to call the function once the sccript is loaded.


Follow up:

To improve the loadScript, you could add a second parameter to the function called 'main', and then use that parameter within the 
loadScript function like so and then call the helloWorld script after:

	function loadScript(src, main) {
    	let script = document.createElement("script");
    	script.src = src;
        scipt.onload = main;
    	document.head.append(script);
  	}
    loadScript('/js/main.js', function() {
        hellowWorld();
    }


    You could also use the defer Attribute and explicitly add the script in for /js/main.js and defer that, which is another option.

<html>
  <head>
	...
	<script>

  	function loadScript(src) {
    	let script = document.createElement("script");
    	script.src = src;
    	document.head.append(script);
  	}
  	loadScript("/js/main.js");
  	helloWorld(); //assuming function helloWorld is in file /js/main.js

  	//Follow-up question:
  	//How would you improve function loadScript to make the script work? Please explain your thoughts.
