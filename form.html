1) Accessibility 

The first glaring items regarding accessibility is lack of ALT tags and aria-label tags.

The <form> tag itself should have an aria-label to identify the group of elements on the page.
    So for example, if the form is for searching, ideally, it would start being structured like so:
    <form method='get' action='/search.php' class=”form” aria-label="Search by Oldest">

The IMG tag is another place where accessibility should be present. In the HTML above, the IMG tag should be:
    <a href='/'><img src='/image.gif' alt="Search" /></a>

    If the image is purely for decoration then a role tag should also be assigned to it so that screen reader skip
    interacting and flagging it for sighted users:
    <a href='/'><img src='/image.gif' alt="Search" role="presentation" /></a>


2) Performace and 3) Legibility

Performance
The other obvious item is that in order for this form to actual be performative on devices, the style should not be set
to display:none; since it will make it invisible to screen readers and should instead use aria-hidden="true"

<form method='get' action='/search.php' class=”form” aria-label="Search by Oldest" aria-hidden="true">

The other performance related item is the lack of INPUT HTML tags, which without, the form cannot actually be used
since there will be no interactive elements. Since the form seems like there needs to be a dropdown, you would need 
to have LABEL and INPUT radio buttons. 

aria label should also be applied to the message dive so that screen readers can recognize it.

Legibility:
Additionally, inconsistent quote marks are present and should be standardized
to use double quotes.

There is also a lack of a Submit button, which is required in order for a form to work.

Refactored:
    </form>
    .
    .
    .
        <input type="text" name="s" id="s" placeholder="Search..." class="input">
        <div class="select">
            <label><input type="radio" name="sort" value="oldest">Oldest</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="sort" value="latest">Latest</label>
        </div>
        <div class=”message” role="alert"></div>
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
