<!-- 
In order to get the three different designs to fit each specified device sizes (Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile) without
using MediqQueries, the easiest and quickest way to accomplish this task is to implement CSS Grids, which will
adjust to viewports automatically depending on the properties provided.

While there is much more work that would need to go into making the below CSS script funtional, I implemented a very
rough idea of how I would begin going about creating a grid system using the 'display: grid' and 'grid-auto-rows: 200px', which sets the width for each article card.

Unfortunately, I ran out of time in getting things perfectly aligned, as the recommended was suggested to be about 2 hours but the general idea is to create a columned CSS grid, setting the grid-auto-rows width to a specific number and going from there.

My next step would have been to play around with alignment of the H1, H2, meta, and teaser CSS selectors so that they aligned to the specifications in conjuction with the CSS grid.
